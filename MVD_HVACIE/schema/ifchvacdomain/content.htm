<h3 class="std">7.1.1 Schema Definition</h3>
 

<p>The <i>IfcHvacDomain</i> schema defines basic object concepts required for interoperability within the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) domain. It extends concepts defined in the <i>IfcSharedBldgServiceElements</i> schema.</p>

<p>The scope of the <i>IfcHvacDomain</i> schema is defined as:</p>
<ol> 
<li>The segments, fittings and connections that constitute duct and piping distribution systems typically used for building services, such as for air conditioning, ventilation and exhaust-air systems; chilled water, steam and heating hot water, potable water, waste, natural gas and LPG systems, etc.</li> 
<li>Equipment typically used in building services systems, such as boilers, chillers, fans, and pumps and the vibration isolation associated with these components.</li>
<li>Terminal and flow control devices, such as air vents and grilles, variable air volume modulators, valves, and dampers.</li> 
</ol> 

<p>The following are deemed to be out of scope of the <i>IfcHvacDomain</i> schema at this time:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Industrial and institutional specialty equipment such as that used for power production, manufacturing and fabrication, etc.</li>
<li>Provisions for dealing explicitly with hazardous materials such as chemical or biological agents</li>
<li>Controls systems and sequencing systems for these equipment beyond what is defined in the <i>IfcBuildingControls</i> domain schema</li>
</ul>
